## Tools Used

The Tools I used for this project: [React](https://react.dev/),   [EmailJs](https://www.emailjs.com/) and [React BootStrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

React and React Bootstrap where mainly used to create the styling seen on the webpage itself. I found that using bootstrap library allowed for me to create elements to be render quickly by what felt like a plug and play with the built in grid system. It allowed me to focus on getting back to creating more projects to add to my portfolio! 

EmailJs is a very helpful plugin to included into any project with a contact for as I just had to for their easy to read docs and pass the proper functions and it was done. They use their own secure servers to send and recieve emails verse nodmailer which isn't secure or supported by many email applications.
