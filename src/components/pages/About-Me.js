            <p>
              Hello, my name is Michael Mount! I am a current Denver Univeristy
              student enrolled in their full-stack flex program. It is a 13 week
              long course that covers what it means to be a full-stack engineer
              in the industry. I started my coding journey 2 months prior to
              starting the program. I have been self teaching with a focus in
              HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Prior to joining DU, I attended the
              University of Northern Colordo and completed my bacholors degree
              in performing Arts and Theatre Studies. I was on the Deans List
              for 3 years and graduated with an overall GPA of 3.8. Once I
              finish with my courses I attend to join the web development
              industry with a high hopes to start a new career in life. Hoping
              to join a team and work with fellow devlopers in building a new
              project!
